## Usage

The application can be accessed though [pomodoro.edurodrigues.dev](https://pomodoro.edurodrigues.dev), but you can also run it locally by cloning the repository.

First you need to install all the dependencies:
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```
Then simply run `start`:
```bash
yarn start
# or
npm run start
```
A browser window will automatically open on `localhost:3000`.
